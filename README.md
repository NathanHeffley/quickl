# Quickl

A lightning fast blog built on NodeJS and Express!

Quickl is a blog framework that allows you to easily create blogs that are lightweight and load quickly. Built with NodeJS and Express, it's simple to set up your own installation of Quickl and get started publishing. Simply clone the project into the location where you'll be running the server and start the Node server. It's as simple as that!
